A "cheap" Markov chain implementation to generate "words" similar to a given wordlist.

Usage: mkword <wordlist>

The wordlist can be in any format really.  The input algorithm will find strings in binary files and use those to seed the chains.  Only "a" through "z" characters are considered.

Don't expect updates.  This was written in a single sitting to satisfy my curiosity.
